Data can be downloaded here: (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)

I also attached the data in .7z compressed file in this repository

This exploratory project answers below questions:
```
--Select all data (250,384 rows)
--Shows only rows with the LATEST data on each country & save it as a temp table called #latest_data
--Show all data for temp table #latest_data
--Looking at Total Cases vs. Total Deaths
--Shows the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19
--Looking at the Total Infections vs. Population
--Show stats per continent
--Creating temp table named #hosp_icu_data to find the most recent data
--How do hospitalization rates and ICU rates vary by country? (34 rows only due to missing hosp & icu data)
--Show the percentage of the population that has been fully vaccinated
--Show the percentage of the population that has been fully vaccinated
```
